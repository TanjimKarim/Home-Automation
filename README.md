# Smart Home Automation System

This project is a feature-rich home automation system powered by modern sensors and the ESP32 module. It provides enhanced safety, convenience, and automation using components like RFID cards, motion detection, and environmental sensors.

## Components Used

1. *Servo Motor*: Used to automate physical mechanisms like door locks or window blinds.
2. *Flame Detector*: Monitors for fire hazards and triggers alerts.
3. *Rain Detector*: Detects rainfall to trigger actions like closing windows or retracting outdoor awnings.
4. *ESP32 Module*: Acts as the main controller, providing Wi-Fi connectivity for remote access and data handling.
5. *RFID Card*: Enables secure access control for doors or specific devices.
6. *Motion Detector*: Detects movement to enhance security or automate lighting.
  
## Features

- *Secure Access*: Use RFID cards to unlock doors or activate specific devices.
- *Fire Safety*: Automatically alerts users and takes action (e.g., activating alarms) when a flame is detected.
- *Rain Automation*: Automates actions like closing windows or sending notifications when rain is detected.
- *Motion-Based Automation*: Turns lights on/off or triggers alarms when motion is detected.
- *Remote Monitoring*: Access real-time sensor data and control devices via Wi-Fi using the ESP32 module.
- *Energy Efficiency*: Automates lights and appliances based on user presence and environmental conditions.

## How It Works

### Workflow:
1. The *ESP32 module* connects to all sensors and actuators, processing real-time data.
2. The *RFID module* authenticates users, controlling access to specific features.
3. The *motion detector* triggers automation tasks like switching lights or activating alarms.
4. The *flame detector* sends alerts and activates safety measures upon detecting fire.
5. The *rain detector* monitors weather conditions and automates relevant actions.
6. The *servo motor* executes physical actions, such as locking/unlocking doors or adjusting blinds.
